# Blog

•	Motivation for the project
This analysis is done to write a blog post related to the findings about students’ performance on tests. 

•	Files in the repository with a small description of each
data_analysis.ipny – notebook file containing the main code used to answer the given questions
StudentsPerformance.csv - file containing the data

•	Summary of the results of the analysis
According to the results gained from data,  following results are observed:

1.	Although male students have higher grades in math, female ones outperform them in both writing and reading courses.

2.	When it comes to the relationship between lunch and scores, we can see from the bar chart above that students who have standard lunch rather than free/reduced gained higher grades (average) no matter the subject.


3.	Above graph indicates that average scores of students who have completed the preparation course in all subjects given in the data are better than those of whom that have not completed.
